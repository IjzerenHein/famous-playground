# Installation

First make sure you have node.js installed... without that nothing works!
You can either install it with your favorite package manager or with [the installer](http://nodejs.org/download) found on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

Install grunt & webpack globally *(if not installed already):*

```
npm install -g grunt-cli webpack webpack-dev-server
```

Install the local npm packages *(from the project root folder):*

```
npm install
```

That's it! You should now be able to build & run the project.


# Building & running

To build the project, use:

```
grunt
```

This runs linters & code-style checkers, and builds the webpack output in: `/www`.
You can open the output `www/index.html` file using `grunt open`.

To start a live reload server, use:

```
grunt serve
```

This starts the webpack-dev-server at `http://localhost:8080` and opens the URL in the browser.

To build for production and minify and mangle the output, use:

```
grunt prod
```
